This chrome extension adds a "CMS ID" button to Chrome.  When you click on it
and type something in, it will search through data/ids.txt for any matching IDs
or names and display them.

To try it out yourself, you can just open chrome://extensions and drag and drop
the folder into your window.

To use this in your organization, fork the repo into your organization's private
github repo, update data/ids.txt with your organization's CMS IDs, then deploy
it as a [Chrome extension private to your organization](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860?hl=en).
