# cms-id-lookup
Lookup your coworkers' CMS IDs easily

To use this in your organization, fork the repo into your
private github repo, update data/ids.txt with your
organization's IDs, then deploy it as a Chrome app.

To try it out yourself, you can just open chrome://extensions
and drag and drop the folder into your window.

When you click on the "CMS ID" button and type something in,
it will search through data/ids.txt for any matching IDs
or names.
